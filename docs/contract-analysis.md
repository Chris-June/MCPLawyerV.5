# Contract Analysis API

## Overview

The Contract Analysis API provides AI-powered analysis of legal contracts, helping legal professionals identify risks, extract clauses, compare different versions of contracts, and generate recommendations for improvements. It leverages GPT-4o-mini to perform deep semantic analysis of contract language and structure.

## Key Features

### 1. AI-Powered Contract Review

- **Clause Extraction**: Automatically identifies and categorizes clauses from legal contracts
- **Risk Assessment**: Evaluates each clause and the overall contract for potential legal risks
- **Risk Scoring**: Calculates an overall contract risk score from 0-100
- **Recommendations**: Provides actionable recommendations for improving contract language
- **Jurisdictional Analysis**: Considers Canadian federal and provincial legal requirements

### 2. Clause Extraction and Categorization

- **Semantic Categorization**: Identifies clause types (indemnification, liability, termination, etc.)
- **Position Tracking**: Maintains location information for each clause within the document
- **Alternative Wording**: Suggests improved language for problematic clauses
- **Legal Concerns**: Highlights specific legal issues within each clause
- **Provincial Considerations**: Notes jurisdiction-specific implications

### 3. Contract Comparison

- **Side-by-Side Comparison**: Compare two versions of a contract to identify changes
- **Clause Differences**: Highlights specific clauses that differ between contracts
- **Significance Analysis**: Evaluates the legal significance of identified differences
- **Structure Comparison**: Identifies clauses unique to each contract
- **Comprehensive Recommendations**: Provides insights based on the comparison results

### 4. Standard Template Comparison

- **Template Library**: Compare contracts against standard templates
- **Similarity Scoring**: Calculate how closely contract clauses match standard templates
- **Divergence Analysis**: Identify areas where contracts deviate from best practices
- **Template Management**: Add and manage standard contract templates

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Components

- **`contract_analysis_models.py`**: Data models for contract analysis, clauses, risk levels, etc.
- **`contract_analysis_service.py`**: Service layer for analyzing contracts and comparing versions
- **`contract_analysis_routes.py`**: API endpoints for the contract analysis system

### Frontend Components

- **`ContractAnalysisPage.tsx`**: Main page for contract analysis and comparison features
- **`ContractAnalysisResult.tsx`**: Component for displaying detailed contract analysis results
- **`ContractComparisonResult.tsx`**: Component for displaying contract comparison results

## API Endpoints

```
POST /api/contract-analysis/analyze - Analyze a single contract
POST /api/contract-analysis/compare - Compare two contracts
POST /api/contract-analysis/templates - Add a standard template
GET /api/contract-analysis/templates/{template_id} - Get a specific template
```

## Usage

### Analyzing a Contract

1. Navigate to the Contract Analysis page
2. Select the "Analyze Contract" tab
3. Enter optional contract details (name, type, jurisdiction)
4. Paste the contract text
5. Click "Analyze Contract"
6. Review the comprehensive analysis of clauses, risks, and recommendations

### Comparing Contracts

1. Navigate to the Contract Analysis page
2. Select the "Compare Contracts" tab
3. Enter names for both contracts (optional)
4. Paste the text of both contracts
5. Click "Compare Contracts"
6. Review the side-by-side comparison and analysis of differences

## AI Integration

The system uses GPT-4o-mini for several key functions:

- Extracting and categorizing clauses from contract text
- Analyzing clauses for risks and legal implications
- Comparing different versions of clauses
- Generating alternative wording suggestions
- Creating overall risk assessments and recommendations

## Future Enhancements

- OCR integration for scanning physical contracts
- Additional template libraries for different industries and jurisdictions
- Export of analysis results in PDF and DOCX formats
- Integration with document management systems
- Batch analysis of multiple contracts
