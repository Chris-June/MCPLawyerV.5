# ClauseLibraryService

## Description

The `ClauseLibraryService` is responsible for managing a library of legal clauses for document assembly. It provides functionalities to retrieve, search, and potentially generate legal clauses. It interacts with the `MemoryService` for managing memories and the `AIProcessor` for processing AI requests.

The service includes the following key functionalities:

- **Clause Initialization:** The service initializes a library of legal clauses with common clauses.
- **Clause Retrieval:** Methods to retrieve clauses by ID, category, or tags.
- **Clause Generation:** Methods to generate new clauses based on user prompts and AI processing.

## How to Use

1.  **Initialization:** Create an instance of the `ClauseLibraryService` class, passing instances of the `MemoryService` and `AIProcessor` as arguments.
2.  **Retrieving Clauses:** Use the methods to retrieve clauses based on different criteria (e.g., ID, category, tags).
3.  **Generating Clauses:** Use the methods to generate new clauses based on user prompts and AI processing.

## How to Extend

1.  **Adding New Clauses:** You can extend the service by adding new clauses to the `_initialize_clauses` method or by implementing methods to add clauses dynamically.
2.  **Custom Clause Categories and Tags:** You can add custom clause categories and tags to the `_initialize_clause_categories` and `_initialize_clause_tags` methods.
3.  **AI-Powered Clause Generation:** You can enhance the clause generation capabilities by leveraging the `AIProcessor` to generate more sophisticated and context-aware clauses.
4.  **Database Integration:** The service currently stores clauses in memory. You can extend the service to store clauses in a database for persistence and scalability.
5.  **Advanced Search Capabilities:** Implement advanced search capabilities using techniques like full-text search or semantic search to improve clause retrieval accuracy.
